## What is Nightwatch?
[Nightwatch.js](http://nightwatchjs.org) is an automated testing framework for web applications and websites, written in Node.js and using the [W3C WebDriver API](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/) (formerly [Selenium WebDriver](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol)).

It is a complete browser (End-to-End) testing solution which aims to simplify the process of setting up Continuous Integration and writing automated tests. Nightwatch can also be used for writing Node.js unit tests.
